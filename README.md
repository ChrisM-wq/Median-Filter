# Median-Filter
A median filter for .png and .jpg images

Serial program works with the following command line inputs:
1. File input name, 2. File output name, 3. Filter size.
Example : 'input.jpg output.jpg 3'

The paralled program runs but need to be configured correctly.
Getting a more optimal parallel version to achieve better speedup (in progress).
